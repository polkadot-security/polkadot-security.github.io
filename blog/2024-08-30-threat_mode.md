Today we are introducing a new section in the Security Hub, [Identify](/identify). This new section focuses on the Identify function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as applied to Polkadot and Substrate-based blockchains. It provides essential resources for identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks within these systems, including threat models, vulnerability analyses, and risk assessment methodologies.

Start by checking out [what threat models are available](/docs/identify/model) today!
