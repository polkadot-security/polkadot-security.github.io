# Disclosures

## Know The Rules Of The Road

When a vulnerability is identified within the Polkadot Ecosystem, what is the approach to follow about its disclosure within Parity, with the parachains, more widely to the Ecosystem.

### Situation

Vulnerability can be discovered by multiple different channels:

1. Internally
   - An employee or contractor
   - By a security provider mandated to perform a review
2. Externally
   - A hacker directly via bug bounty
   - Via parachains: directly or via their bug bounty scheme or auditors/pentesters
   - Via ecosystem

### Approach

In case Parity is made aware of a vulnerability which may impact the ecosystem, it is communicated with the following approach. The same reciprocal approach has been discussed with the parachains to be consistent.
