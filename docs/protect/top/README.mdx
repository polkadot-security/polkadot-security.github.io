# Polkadot Top Ten

The Polkadot Top 10 is a document designed to understand in detail the top ten most common and specific security vulnerabilities that can happen in Polkadot SDK development. The goal is to help you understand what are the risks, how they can affect a Substrate-based blockchain, and how to protect against them. Knowing about these vulnerabilities can help make Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem safer for everyone.

:::info 

The Top Ten vulnerabilities are in constant evolution, new vulnerabilities may be added to the list, and existing ones may be moved to the [Polkadot Base](/protect/base) as they become less common.
