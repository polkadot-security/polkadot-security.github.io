# Security Tools & Testing Infrastructure

This section covers the various tools and infrastructure available for securing and testing your Polkadot/Substrate-based system. These tools help catch issues early, validate functionality, and ensure system security.

## Supply Chain Management

- [**PSVM**](/psvm) - A tool for managing your Polkadot dependencies in a precise and secure way.
- [**Cargo Vet**](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet) - A tool for auditing your Cargo.toml file to check if your dependencies are audited.
- [**Cargo Audit**](https://github.com/rustsec/cargo-audit) - A tool for auditing your Cargo.lock file to check if your dependencies have any known vulnerabilities.

## Static Analysers

Static analysis tools help catch common issues and enforce best practices without running the code:

- [**Clippy**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) - The official Rust linter that catches common mistakes and suggests improvements. Includes specific lints for Substrate/Polkadot development.
- [**Dylint**](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) - A tool for running custom Rust lints, including specialized ones for runtime development and common security pitfalls.

## Unit Testing

Tools for testing individual components in isolation:

- [**XCM Simulator**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/polkadot/xcm/xcm-simulator) - Test cross-chain message passing logic in a controlled environment without full network setup.
- [**Nextest**](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest) - A modern, fast test runner for Rust with improved parallel test execution and better reporting.

## Integration Testing

For testing multiple components working together:

- [**XCM Emulator**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator) - Test cross-chain XCM interactions between multiple parachains and relay chains in a simulated environment.
- [**Try Runtime**](https://github.com/paritytech/try-runtime-cli) - Test runtime upgrades and state transitions against real chain state without affecting the live network.

## Fuzzing

Automated testing tools that generate random inputs to find edge cases and vulnerabilities:

- [**Substrate Runtime Fuzzer**](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-runtime-fuzzer) - Integrate your runtime, and test everything at once.Supports multiple fuzzing engines:
  - AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) - Traditional coverage-guided fuzzing
  - Honggfuzz - Modern, multi-threaded fuzzing with hardware support

Find more information in the [Fuzzing](/fuzzing) section.

## E2E Testing

End-to-end testing tools for validating full system behavior:

- [**Zombienet**](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) - A testing framework for spawning and testing Polkadot/Substrate networks, with SDK support for custom test scenarios.
- [**Zombienet SDK**](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet-sdk) - A library for building custom test scenarios for Zombienet in Rust.
- [**Chopsticks**](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) - A mock execution environment for testing parachain logic against real network state.

## Testnets

Public test networks for safely deploying and validating changes:

- **Rococo** - The primary testnet for parachain teams, featuring regular resets and testing slots.
- **Westend** - Long-running testnet that mirrors Polkadot's configuration, ideal for validator testing.
- **Paseo** - Specialized testnet for testing specific features or scenarios.

## Canary Network

Production environment for early detection of issues:

- **Kusama** - The canary network for Polkadot, running new features in a real economic environment.
