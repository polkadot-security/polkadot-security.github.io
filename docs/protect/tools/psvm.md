# Polkadot SDK Version Manager

PSVM is a simple tool to manage and update the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) dependencies in any Cargo.toml file. It will automatically update the Polkadot SDK dependencies to their correct [crates.io](https://crates.io) version, so you can be protected from [Outdated Crates](/docs/outdated-crates) vulnerabilities.
